              <small>Docker will eventually be able to target FreeBSD, Solaris and maybe OS X.</small>
            </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              So who is docker for? Its for developers.
              Docker gives developers the choice to develop with any software without having to affect their development machine.
              These docker containers isolate processes from the kernel and creates an environment that they can work in or completely trash.
              Currently docker is specifically targeted for Linux systems, so mac users (myself included) will have to wait until docker fully supports those platforms (hopefully we'll see this in 1.0).

            <aside class="notes">
              So who else is docker for? Its for server ops.  A server op wants to setup a container that is arch Linux, then they can do so.
              Any cloud - Docker on EC2, no problem; on Digital Ocean, no sweat; Rackspace? Docker's got this.
              Its recommended that docker be run on the latest distribution of a Linux system with kernel 3.8 due to a number of kernel bugs or even crashes that include:
              a container being killed in the middle of an operation (ex. apt-get doesn't complete);
              kernel crash causing the machine to freeze for a few minutes, or even completely.
              Its possible to use older kernels for development, but not recommended.
              To prevent this from happening, docker will check the kernel version when it starts, and emits a warning if it detects something older than 3.8

              What problems does docker solve?
              Its hard to think of what containers can help us with as developers and server ops.
              So lets take a look at an analogy taken from the world of shipping.
            </aside>

          <section>
            <h3>A history lesson</h3>

            <img width="100%" height="100%" src="images/analogy.jpg" />

            <aside class="notes">
              Before 1960, most cargo was shipped break bulk.
              Shippers and carriers alike needed to worry about bad interactions between different types of cargo.
              Ex.if a shipment of anvils fell on a crate of watermelons, its funny, but someone will be upset.
              Also transitions between different modes of transport were painful.
              Good had to be unloaded from ships and reloaded onto trains, trucks, etc.
              Along that transition theft and damage were large.
              So there is an X matrix between good and the types of transport.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>A history lesson</h3>

            <img width="100%" height="100%" src="images/standard_container.jpg" />

            <aside class="notes">
              So the solution was the international shipping container
              Any type of good can be packaged inside the shipping container, from cars to pianos.
              The container can then be sealed, and not re-opened until it reaches it final destination.
              Between that period containers can be loaded, unloaded, stacked, transported, and efficiently moved over long distances.
              Transfers become automated without modification to the container and everybody's happy.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>A container for system code</h3>

            <img width="100%" height="100%" src="images/the_challenge.jpg" />

            <aside class="notes">
              Developers and server ops face the same challenge.
              Multiple software packages, frameworks, systems, APIs etc, for multiple VM's servers, developer machines etc.
              So it can be frustrating sometimes to manage all this without creating shell scripts to manage this.
              So thats where docker comes in to simplify this by wrapping linux containers in an easy to use software package.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>A container for system code</h3>

            <img width="100%" height="100%" src="images/docker_container.jpg" />

            <aside class="notes">Solution to the problem, the Linux container</aside>
            <aside class="notes">
              At the same extent Docker can be thought of as an international shipping container system for code.
              We can now package code, frameworks, databases, systems etc. within a container and ship it to multiple hardware environments.
              So its these Linux containers are the secret sauce that makes docker tick.

            <h3>Linux Containers</h3>

            <p>Units of software delivery <b>(ship it!)</b></p>

            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                Run everywhere
                <ul>
                  <li>Regardless of kernel version (*cough 3.8 cough*)</li>
                  <li>Regardless of host distribution</li>
                  <li>(*but container and host architecture must match*)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Run anything
                <ul>
                  <li>If it can run on the host, it can run in the container</li>
                  <li>i.e.; If it can run on a Linux kernel, it can run</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <br />

            <p><small>*Unless you emulate CPU with qemu and binfmt</small></p>

            <aside class="notes">
              The beauty of Linux containers is that you can run it practically anywhere on any kernel.
              And the ability to run whatever you want inside the container without modifying the host environment.
              So lets get a broad scope of what a container is.

            <h2>What's a Container</h2>

            <p>From 10,000 feet</p>
            <p>Its a lightweight VM</p>

            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>Own process space</li>
              <li>Own network interface</li>
              <li>Can run stuff as root</li>
              <li>Can have its own sbin/init (different from host)</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              A container is its own process space.
              A container is its own network interface.
              A container can run stuff on its host environment as root.
              A container has its own init call to start processes within itself.
              Now lets take a closer look.
            </aside>

            <h2>What's a Container</h2>

            <p>Looking closer</p>
            <p>Its chroot on steroids</p>

            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>Container = isolated process(es)</li>
              <li>Share kernel with host</li>
              <li>No device emulation</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              Basically its chroot with more bells and whistles. A container is effectively jailed and cannot modify its parent hosting environment, unless the container is elevated as a privileged container.
              The container uses the same kernel as the host.
              The container doesn't emulate I/O devices or hardware components
              Containers allow use to isolate and separate what we want to work with where we want to work with it.
            </aside>

						<h2>Separations of Concerns</h2>

            <p>For Developers</p>

            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                Inside my container
                <ul>
                  <li>My code</li>
                  <li>My libraries</li>
                  <li>My package manager</li>
                  <li>My app</li>
                  <li>My data</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              So our developer can write within a development container with their code, libraries, dependency manager, app and data.
              Then they can ship that off to QA or server ops for testing, or even off to another developer.

						<h2>Separations of Concerns</h2>

            <p>For Server Ops</p>

            <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                Outside the container
                <ul>
                  <li>Logging</li>
                  <li>Remote access</li>
                  <li>Network configuration</li>
                  <li>Monitoring</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              Server Ops can now take the isolated environment and without having to manipulate their own environment proceed with what they do best.
              Logging, configuring remote access, network configuration and monitoring of the application or software.
              This I feel is the strong suit of Docker, the separation of concerns among individuals.
              So how does this all work?
